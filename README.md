# Calibrate_Camera

use calibrate.py for picam camera or any other camera calibration
image path needs to modified in calibrate.py

calibrate_cam_mp.py is same but uses multiprocessing for image loading but has no visualization of detected markers

default set of images for calibration are located in 
/data/DataBox/Data_New/forklift/calibration_marker/picam_calib/images_1640_1232_C95
